# Nematic-Liquid-Crystals
A collection of matlab files for analyzing patterns and defects in data from electroconvection experiments with nematic liquid crystals. 
Most of the work is done in the long script LevelSetPersistence.m
Persistent Homology code from Duke and experimental data from Kent State University are not included in the repository, due to lack of permission,
so for now none of the code will actually run.
